Client Program Documentation
===========================

Building and Usage:
-------------------
To build the client program, use the command: make client
To run the client program, use the command: ./client <buffer_size> [-s <packet_drop_chance>]

Note that the clients ip is automatically set to local ::1 (ipv6)

Command-line Arguments:
----------------------
- <buffer_size>: The size of the audio buffer in bytes. 
    The actual minimum and maximum values depend on the audio being transmitted. 
    Incorrect buffer size values will be reported while connecting to the server.

- -s <packet_drop_chance> (Optional): 
    Sets the chance of packet drop as an integer value. 
    If provided, this flag must be followed by the packet drop chance.

Significant Implementation Choices:
-----------------------------------
- Quality Selection: The client program supports different quality levels for audio transmission. 
    It dynamically adjusts the quality level based on the number of dropped frames in received packets. 
    This is done by checking how many packets are dropped every 20 frames. This number of frames can be 
    changed in the asp.h header under the define PACKETS_Checked
    The quality level may change frequently between normal audio, 8 bits, and missing packets.

- Error Handling: The client program uses an error function that handles error messages and exits the program. 
    Error messages must be printed before calling the error.

Additional Notes:
-----------------
- The server program can handle only one connection at a time. 
    If the client program returns an error, the server must be restarted before accepting a new connection.
- Some memory leaks may be present in the program due to the SDL2 library.
