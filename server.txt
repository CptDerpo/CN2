Server Program Documentation
===========================

Building and Usage:
-------------------
To build the server program, use the command: make server
To run the server program, use the command: ./server <filename> <address> [-s <min_delay> <max_delay>]

Command-line Arguments:
----------------------
- <filename>: The name of the file containing the audio data to be sent (must be in pcm_s16le).
- <address>: The IP address or hostname on which the server listens for connections.
- -s <min_delay> <max_delay>: (Optional) Sets the minimum and maximum delay in milliseconds for simulating network delays.
    This flag also enables the out of order transmission of packets. min_delay and max_delay must be provided.

Significant Implementation Choices:
-----------------------------------
- Quality Selection: The server listens to requests from the client, and replies to them. The client decides the quality of data
    the server must sent. 
- Packet transmission: The server sends data packets in bursts and other responses as single packets.

Additional Notes:
-----------------
- The server program can only listen to 1 client and if the client disconnects, the server won't be aware of
    this and therefore must be restarted manually.
